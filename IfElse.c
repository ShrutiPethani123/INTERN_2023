10. Take input from user in seconds and convert into hours , min and sec.

    sec = 190056

    52:47:36  -> (52*3600 + 47*60 + 36)

11. Write a program to input electricity unit charge and calculate the total 
	electricity bill according to the given condition:

	For first 50 units Rs. 0.50/unit
	For next 100 units Rs. 0.75/unit
	For next 100 units Rs. 1.20/unit
	For unit above 250 Rs. 1.50/unit

	300 
	50 - 0.50 = 25
	100 - 0.75=75
	100 - 1.20 = 120
	50 - 1.50  = 75   
    
    total  bill- 295

    -> 20

    20 - 0.50 = 10

    total bill - 10

    -> 120

    25 + 70*0.75 = > 77.5
